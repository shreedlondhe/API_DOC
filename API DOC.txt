Q2)Test Cases for API Security Testing
ans: API security testing is the process of evaluating an API to ensure it is secure from vulnerabilities, threats, and unauthorized access. It focuses on identifying and mitigating security risks in the API's implementation and usage. The goal is to protect sensitive data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure the API behaves as expected under various conditions.
+ve Verify the API enforces HTTPS for secure communication.
    Verify the API accepts valid authentication tokens.
    Verify the API encrypts sensitive data in transit.
-ve Verify the API rejects requests over HTTP.
    Verify the API denies access with invalid or expired tokens.
    Verify the API prevents SQL injection attacks by rejecting malicious payloads.
    Verify the API blocks requests with malformed JSON or XML.
    Verify the API limits the number of requests to prevent brute force attacks.
    Verify the API does not expose sensitive information in error messages.

Q3)API testing types
ans: Functional Testing,Integration Testing,Performance Testing:,Security Testing,Validation Testing.Error Handling Testing,Regression Testing.

Q4)How do you handle dynamic values in API responses (e.g., tokens, timestamps)?
ans:
    Extract dynamic values using scripting or programming languages(store as staic global variables).
    Store dynamic values in variables (postman- env variables)for reuse in subsequent requests.

Q5)What is the purpose of headers in API requests, and can you give examples of commonly used headers?
ans: Headers in API requests provide additional information about the request or response, such as content type, authentication details, and caching instructions. Commonly used headers include:
    Content-Type: Specifies the media type of the resource (e.g., application/json).
    Authorization: Contains credentials for authenticating the client (e.g., Bearer token).
    Accept: Indicates the media types that the client can process (e.g., application/xml).
    User-Agent: Identifies the client software making the request.
    Cache-Control: Directs caching behavior (e.g., no-cache, max-age).

ans:
Q7)How do you perform performance testing for APIs, and what tools do you use (e.g., JMeter, LoadRunner)?
ans:
    Identify performance requirements and key metrics (e.g., response time, throughput).
    Create test scenarios that simulate real-world usage patterns.
    Use tools like JMeter or LoadRunner to generate load on the API.
    Monitor system performance during the test (CPU, memory, network).
    Analyze results to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.

Q8)What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous APIs, and how do you test them?
ans:
| **Aspect**          | **Synchronous API**                                                           | **Asynchronous API**                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**      | Client sends a request and waits for the server to respond before continuing. | Client sends a request and continues without waiting for the response. The response arrives later (via callback, webhook, or polling). |
| **Blocking Nature** | **Blocking** – the client is blocked until it gets a response.                | **Non-blocking** – the client can perform other tasks while waiting for the response.                                                  |
| **Example**         | REST API call where client waits for a response (e.g., `GET /user/123`).      | Message queue or event-based APIs (e.g., Kafka, Webhooks, WebSockets).                                                                 |
| **Use Case**        | When immediate response is needed (e.g., login, fetch data).                  | When processing takes time (e.g., video processing, report generation).                                                                |
| **Response Time**   | Usually faster overall because it’s direct.                                   | Response might come after some delay, depending on processing.                                                                         |

Q9)How would you test an API that has no documentation available?
ans: If there’s no documentation, I start by exploring and understanding the API.
     First, I check available resources like codebase, Swagger files, or frontend network calls (using browser DevTools) to identify the endpoints, request methods, and parameters.
     Then, I use tools like Postman or cURL to send test requests and observe responses — this helps me understand input requirements, response structure, and error codes.

     I perform exploratory testing by trying different inputs (valid, invalid, missing fields) to identify validations and hidden business rules.
     I also look for patterns in the responses to infer data formats and relationships.
     Finally, I document my findings to create a reference for future testing and share it with the team.

Q10)How do you test an API that interacts with third-party services?
ans:When an API interacts with third-party services, I first identify all external dependencies and understand how data flows between our system and the third party.
    For testing, I use mocking or stubbing tools (like Postman Mock Server, WireMock, or Mockito) to simulate the third-party responses so testing doesn’t rely on external systems.

    I verify:
    Request format (headers, payloads, authentication tokens)
    Response handling (success, failure, timeouts, invalid data)
    Error and retry logic (e.g., 500 errors, network failures)
    Security aspects (API keys, OAuth tokens)
    In integration environments, I also run end-to-end tests with the real third-party service to ensure compatibility and data accuracy.
    Finally, I monitor logs and response times to validate performance and stability under real conditions.

Q11)What would you do if an API returns inconsistent responses during testing?
ans:
    First, I would document the inconsistencies, noting the specific requests and responses.
    Then, I would analyze the patterns to see if inconsistencies are tied to specific parameters, headers, or conditions (e.g., time of day, user roles).
    I would also check for any rate limiting or throttling that might affect responses.
    Next, I would communicate with the development team to investigate potential issues in the API implementation or backend services.
    If possible, I would set up logging or monitoring to capture more detailed information about the requests and responses.
    Finally, I would rerun tests after any fixes or changes to ensure the inconsistencies are resolved.

Q12)How do you test APIs for rate limiting and throttling?
ans:To test rate limiting and throttling, I first identify the allowed request limit (e.g., 100 requests/min). Then I use tools like JMeter, Postman Runner, or scripts to send multiple requests in a short time.
    I check how the API behaves when the limit is reached:
    It should return the correct status code (e.g., 429 – Too Many Requests)
    The response should include details like Retry-After headers
    It should not crash or become unstable
    I also test the reset behavior — after the limit window passes, new requests should be accepted again.
    In addition, I verify throttling ensures fair usage and doesn’t affect normal users.


Q13)How do you ensure backward compatibility when testing APIs after an update?
ans: When an API is updated, I ensure backward compatibility by verifying that existing clients and integrations continue to work without any changes.

     I do this by:
     Running regression tests using the old API test suite on the new version.
     Comparing old and new responses — checking that the structure, data types, and status codes haven’t changed unexpectedly.
     Ensuring deprecated fields or endpoints still function as expected or return proper warnings.
     Testing different API versions (v1, v2) side by side to confirm they coexist properly.
     Validating contract tests using tools like Postman, Pact, or Swagger Diff to detect any schema breaking changes.
     Finally, I communicate with developers if breaking changes are necessary and ensure proper versioning and documentation are maintained.

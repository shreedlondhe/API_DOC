Q1)Test cases for authentication API
ans:
+ve Verify successful authentication with valid credentials.
    Verify the response contains a valid token upon successful authentication.
    Verify the token expiration time is returned in the response.
    Verify the API allows access to protected resources with a valid token.
-ve Verify authentication fails with invalid credentials.
    Verify authentication fails with missing username or password.
    Verify authentication fails with an expired token.
    Verify authentication fails with a malformed or invalid token.
    Verify the API returns an error for requests without an authentication token.

Q2)Test Cases for API Security Testing
ans: API security testing is the process of evaluating an API to ensure it is secure from vulnerabilities, threats, and unauthorized access. It focuses on identifying and mitigating security risks in the API's implementation and usage. The goal is to protect sensitive data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure the API behaves as expected under various conditions.
+ve Verify the API enforces HTTPS for secure communication.
    Verify the API accepts valid authentication tokens.
    Verify the API encrypts sensitive data in transit.
-ve Verify the API rejects requests over HTTP.
    Verify the API denies access with invalid or expired tokens.
    Verify the API prevents SQL injection attacks by rejecting malicious payloads.
    Verify the API blocks requests with malformed JSON or XML.
    Verify the API limits the number of requests to prevent brute force attacks.
    Verify the API does not expose sensitive information in error messages.

Q3)API testing types
ans: Functional Testing,Integration Testing,Performance Testing:,Security Testing,Validation Testing.Error Handling Testing,Regression Testing.

Q4)How do you handle dynamic values in API responses (e.g., tokens, timestamps)?
ans:
    Extract dynamic values using scripting or programming languages(store as staic global variables).
    Store dynamic values in variables (postman- env variables)for reuse in subsequent requests.

Q5)What is the purpose of headers in API requests, and can you give examples of commonly used headers?
ans: Headers in API requests provide additional information about the request or response, such as content type, authentication details, and caching instructions. Commonly used headers include:
    Content-Type: Specifies the media type of the resource (e.g., application/json).
    Authorization: Contains credentials for authenticating the client (e.g., Bearer token).
    Accept: Indicates the media types that the client can process (e.g., application/xml).
    User-Agent: Identifies the client software making the request.
    Cache-Control: Directs caching behavior (e.g., no-cache, max-age).
Q6)How do you test the security of an API (e.g., testing for SQL injection, XSS, or token validation)?
ans:
Q7)How do you perform performance testing for APIs, and what tools do you use (e.g., JMeter, LoadRunner)?
ans:
    Identify performance requirements and key metrics (e.g., response time, throughput).
    Create test scenarios that simulate real-world usage patterns.
    Use tools like JMeter or LoadRunner to generate load on the API.
    Monitor system performance during the test (CPU, memory, network).
    Analyze results to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.

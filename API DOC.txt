    Verify the API does not expose sensitive information in error messages.

Q3)API testing types
ans: Functional Testing,Integration Testing,Performance Testing:,Security Testing,Validation Testing.Error Handling Testing,Regression Testing.

Q4)How do you handle dynamic values in API responses (e.g., tokens, timestamps)?
ans:
    Extract dynamic values using scripting or programming languages(store as staic global variables).
    Store dynamic values in variables (postman- env variables)for reuse in subsequent requests.

Q5)What is the purpose of headers in API requests, and can you give examples of commonly used headers?
ans: Headers in API requests provide additional information about the request or response, such as content type, authentication details, and caching instructions. Commonly used headers include:
    Content-Type: Specifies the media type of the resource (e.g., application/json).
    Authorization: Contains credentials for authenticating the client (e.g., Bearer token).
    Accept: Indicates the media types that the client can process (e.g., application/xml).
    User-Agent: Identifies the client software making the request.
    Cache-Control: Directs caching behavior (e.g., no-cache, max-age).
Q6)How do you test the security of an API (e.g., testing for SQL injection, XSS, or token validation)?
ans:
Q7)How do you perform performance testing for APIs, and what tools do you use (e.g., JMeter, LoadRunner)?
ans:
    Identify performance requirements and key metrics (e.g., response time, throughput).
    Create test scenarios that simulate real-world usage patterns.
    Use tools like JMeter or LoadRunner to generate load on the API.
    Monitor system performance during the test (CPU, memory, network).
    Analyze results to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.

Q8)What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous APIs, and how do you test them?
ans:
| **Aspect**          | **Synchronous API**                                                           | **Asynchronous API**                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**      | Client sends a request and waits for the server to respond before continuing. | Client sends a request and continues without waiting for the response. The response arrives later (via callback, webhook, or polling). |
| **Blocking Nature** | **Blocking** – the client is blocked until it gets a response.                | **Non-blocking** – the client can perform other tasks while waiting for the response.                                                  |
| **Example**         | REST API call where client waits for a response (e.g., `GET /user/123`).      | Message queue or event-based APIs (e.g., Kafka, Webhooks, WebSockets).                                                                 |
| **Use Case**        | When immediate response is needed (e.g., login, fetch data).                  | When processing takes time (e.g., video processing, report generation).                                                                |
| **Response Time**   | Usually faster overall because it’s direct.                                   | Response might come after some delay, depending on processing.                                                                         |

Q9)How would you test an API that has no documentation available?
ans: If there’s no documentation, I start by exploring and understanding the API.
     First, I check available resources like codebase, Swagger files, or frontend network calls (using browser DevTools) to identify the endpoints, request methods, and parameters.
     Then, I use tools like Postman or cURL to send test requests and observe responses — this helps me understand input requirements, response structure, and error codes.

     I perform exploratory testing by trying different inputs (valid, invalid, missing fields) to identify validations and hidden business rules.
     I also look for patterns in the responses to infer data formats and relationships.
     Finally, I document my findings to create a reference for future testing and share it with the team.

Q10)How do you test an API that interacts with third-party services?
ans:When an API interacts with third-party services, I first identify all external dependencies and understand how data flows between our system and the third party.
    For testing, I use mocking or stubbing tools (like Postman Mock Server, WireMock, or Mockito) to simulate the third-party responses so testing doesn’t rely on external systems.
    I verify:
    Request format (headers, payloads, authentication tokens)
    Response handling (success, failure, timeouts, invalid data)
    Error and retry logic (e.g., 500 errors, network failures)
    Security aspects (API keys, OAuth tokens)
    In integration environments, I also run end-to-end tests with the real third-party service to ensure compatibility and data accuracy.
    Finally, I monitor logs and response times to validate performance and stability under real conditions.

Q11)What would you do if an API returns inconsistent responses during testing?
ans:
    First, I would document the inconsistencies, noting the specific requests and responses.
    Then, I would analyze the patterns to see if inconsistencies are tied to specific parameters, headers, or conditions (e.g., time of day, user roles).
    I would also check for any rate limiting or throttling that might affect responses.
    Next, I would communicate with the development team to investigate potential issues in the API implementation or backend services.
    If possible, I would set up logging or monitoring to capture more detailed information about the requests and responses.
    Finally, I would rerun tests after any fixes or changes to ensure the inconsistencies are resolved.

Q12)How do you test APIs for rate limiting and throttling?
ans:To test rate limiting and throttling, I first identify the allowed request limit (e.g., 100 requests/min). Then I use tools like JMeter, Postman Runner, or scripts to send multiple requests in a short time.
    I check how the API behaves when the limit is reached:
    It should return the correct status code (e.g., 429 – Too Many Requests)
    The response should include details like Retry-After headers
    It should not crash or become unstable
    I also test the reset behavior — after the limit window passes, new requests should be accepted again.
    In addition, I verify throttling ensures fair usage and doesn’t affect normal users.


Q13)How do you ensure backward compatibility when testing APIs after an update?
ans: When an API is updated, I ensure backward compatibility by verifying that existing clients and integrations continue to work without any changes.

     I do this by:
     Running regression tests using the old API test suite on the new version.
     Comparing old and new responses — checking that the structure, data types, and status codes haven’t changed unexpectedly.
     Ensuring deprecated fields or endpoints still function as expected or return proper warnings.
     Testing different API versions (v1, v2) side by side to confirm they coexist properly.
     Validating contract tests using tools like Postman, Pact, or Swagger Diff to detect any schema breaking changes.
     Finally, I communicate with developers if breaking changes are necessary and ensure proper versioning and documentation are maintained.

Q14)Can you describe a challenging API testing scenario you faced and how you resolved it?
ans: In one project, I was testing a payment API that interacted with multiple third-party gateways. The challenge was that responses from the gateways were asynchronous and sometimes delayed, which made it difficult to validate transaction statuses in real time.
    1️⃣ Challenge: Handling Dynamic Authentication Tokens
    While testing a banking API, the authentication tokens expired every few minutes, causing most automated test cases to fail.
    Solution: I implemented a pre-request script in Postman (and token refresh logic in Rest Assured) to automatically generate and store new tokens before each test run. This made the entire test suite stable and reusable in CI/CD.
    3️⃣ Challenge: Dealing with Flaky Responses in Asynchronous APIs
    While testing a report-generation API, the response wasn’t instant — results came after a few minutes.
    Solution: I built a polling mechanism in my test scripts to check the report status every few seconds until it changed to “COMPLETED.” This ensured reliability and consistent testing even for delayed responses.
    Challenge: Data Dependency Between APIs
    4️⃣Some APIs required data from previous calls (like userID from registration API for login and transaction APIs).
    Solution: I used chained requests in Postman and data-driven tests in Rest Assured, storing dynamic values from one response and reusing them in subsequent requests automatically.
    5️⃣ Challenge: Validating Large JSON Responses
    The account statement API returned huge JSON data with nested structures, making manual validation difficult.
    Solution: I used JSON schema validation in Rest Assured to ensure the structure, data types, and mandatory fields were correct — saving time and increasing accuracy.
    7️⃣ Challenge: Ensuring Backward Compatibility
    After an API update, older clients started failing.
    Solution: I maintained regression test suites for old versions and used contract testing (Pact) to automatically detect breaking changes between old and new API contracts.

Q15)How do you prioritize API test cases in a large project?
ans: In a large project, I prioritize API test cases based on business impact, critical functionality, and risk.
Critical Business Flows First:
APIs that handle login, payment, transactions, or core workflows are tested first.
Example: In a banking project, fund transfer or account creation APIs have the highest priority.
Frequency of Use:
APIs used frequently by end users are tested next.
Example: Statement fetch, balance inquiry APIs.
Risk and Complexity:
APIs prone to errors, having complex logic, or interacting with third-party services are given high priority.
New Features vs Regression:
Newly developed or updated APIs are tested immediately.
Regression tests are prioritized based on impact on existing clients.
Dependency and Integration:
APIs that other services depend on are tested early to avoid cascading failures.
Automation Potential:
High-priority APIs that are stable and critical are automated first for faster regression in CI/CD pipelines.

Q16)How do you collaborate with developers to debug API issues?
ans: I collaborate with developers by maintaining open communication channels (like Slack, Teams) for quick discussions.
    I provide detailed bug reports with steps to reproduce, request and response payloads, headers, and any relevant logs or screenshots.
    I use API testing tools (Postman, Swagger) to share collections or environments that can help developers replicate the issue.
    I participate in joint debugging sessions where we can analyze logs, monitor network traffic (using tools like Fiddler or Wireshark), and review code if necessary.
    I also suggest potential causes based on my testing experience and work together to identify root causes and solutions.
    Finally, I verify fixes by retesting the issues once developers have addressed them.

Q17)How do you ensure the quality of APIs in an Agile environment?
ans: In an Agile environment, I ensure the quality of APIs by integrating testing into the development process from the start.
    I participate in sprint planning to understand requirements and define acceptance criteria for API features.
    I create and maintain automated test suites (using Postman, Rest Assured) that can be run in CI/CD pipelines to provide quick feedback on code changes.
    I perform exploratory testing alongside automated tests to uncover edge cases and unexpected behaviors.
    I collaborate closely with developers and product owners to clarify requirements, discuss potential issues, and ensure alignment on quality goals.
    I also review API documentation to ensure it is accurate and up-to-date, which helps both testers and developers.
    Finally, I monitor API performance and error rates in production using tools like New Relic or Datadog to catch issues early.

Q18)How do you handle API testing when the backend is still under development?
ans: When the backend is still under development, I use mocking and stubbing techniques to simulate API responses.
    I create mock servers using tools like Postman Mock Server, WireMock, or JSON Server to mimic the expected behavior of the API endpoints.
    I define the request and response structures based on available documentation or discussions with developers.
    I also use contract testing (with tools like Pact) to define and verify the expected interactions between services, ensuring that once the backend is ready, it adheres to the agreed-upon contracts.
    Additionally, I focus on testing the frontend or client-side logic that interacts with the API, ensuring that it can handle various response scenarios (success, error, timeouts).
    I maintain close communication with developers to stay updated on backend progress and adjust my tests accordingly as the API evolves.

Q19)How do you handle versioning in APIs, and why is it important?
ans: API versioning is essential to ensure that updates or new features do not break existing clients. It allows old and new versions to coexist, giving consumers time to migrate.
     How I handle versioning:
     a)Identify version strategy
      URL versioning: e.g., /api/v1/users
      Header versioning: e.g., Accept: application/vnd.myapp.v1+json
      Query parameter versioning: e.g., /api/users?version=1
     b)Test multiple versions
       Validate that existing clients still work on older versions.
       Verify new functionality in the latest version.
       Ensure backward compatibility by running regression tests on previous versions.
     c)Communicate changes
       Document version changes and deprecations clearly in API documentation.
       Notify consumers about upcoming changes and provide migration guides.

Q20)What is the difference between REST and SOAP APIs, and how does that impact your testing approach?
ans:
| **Aspect**         | **REST API**                | **SOAP API**                                      |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Protocol**       | Uses HTTP/HTTPS             | Uses SOAP protocol (can be over HTTP, SMTP, etc.) |
| **Message Format** | Typically JSON (can be XML) | XML only                                          |
| **Architecture**   | Stateless, resource-based   | Standardized operations (RPC style)               |
| **Flexibility**    | Lightweight, easy to use    | Heavy, strict standards (WS-Security, WSDL)       |
| **Error Handling** | Uses HTTP status codes      | Uses SOAP fault messages                          |
| **Caching**        | Supports HTTP caching       | Limited caching support                           |
| **Security**       | Relies on HTTPS, OAuth, JWT | WS-Security, XML Encryption, Digital Signatures   |


Q21)How do you test for rate limiting in APIs, and what strategies do you use to handle it?
ans: Rate limiting ensures that a client cannot exceed a predefined number of API calls in a given time frame. To test it, I first identify the API’s rate limit (e.g., 100 requests/min) and then simulate multiple requests using tools like Postman Runner, JMeter, or custom scripts.
Testing Approach:
   Positive Test: Send requests within the allowed limit to ensure the API responds normally.
   Negative Test: Exceed the limit and validate that the API returns the correct status code (429 Too Many Requests) and appropriate headers (e.g., Retry-After).
   Reset Window Test: Wait for the rate limit window to reset and confirm that requests are accepted again.
   Concurrent Testing: Test with multiple clients to ensure fair usage and no server crashes.
Strategies to Handle Rate Limiting:
   Throttling: Add delays or retries in automated tests to respect the limit.
   Token Bucket / Queue Simulation: Simulate multiple users while keeping requests within limits.
   Monitoring: Log API responses and track limits in test scripts to avoid unnecessary failures.

Q22)How do you ensure that your API tests are maintainable and reusable?
ans:  To make API tests maintainable and reusable, I follow best practices in **test design, automation, and data management**.
     **My Approach:**
     1.Modular Test Design:
         Break tests into independent, reusable components** (like setup, request, validation, teardown).
         Use helper methods or utility classes for common tasks (authentication, data creation, response parsing).
     2.Data-Driven Testing:
         Use external data sources (Excel, JSON, CSV, or databases) to drive multiple test scenarios with the same test logic.
     3.Environment Configuration:
         Use property files or environment variables** for base URLs, tokens, or endpoints to avoid hardcoding.
     4.Standardized Assertions:
         Use common validation methods for status codes, response schemas, and error messages.
     5.Automation Framework Best Practices
        Organize tests by functionality or modules.
        Implement **logging and reporting** for easy debugging.
        Integrate tests into **CI/CD pipelines** for continuous execution.
     6. Documentation & Naming Conventions
        Clear naming of test cases and consistent structure makes it easy for the team to reuse and maintain tests.
 **Summary:** Modular design, data-driven approach, configuration management, and standardization make API tests reusable, maintainable, and scalable over time.

Q23)What is the role of API documentation in testing, and how do you ensure that your tests align with the documentation?
ans: API documentation plays a crucial role in testing as it provides the necessary information about endpoints, request/response formats, authentication methods, and error codes. It serves as a reference for understanding how the API is supposed to function and what to expect from it.

Q24)How do you test for data integrity in APIs, especially when dealing with CRUD operations?
ans: To test for data integrity in APIs, especially with CRUD operations, I follow these steps:
     1.Create (POST):
         Send a request to create a new resource and validate the response status code (201 Created).
         Verify that the response body contains the correct data and that the resource is stored correctly in the database (if accessible).
     2.Read (GET):
         Retrieve the created resource using its ID and validate the response status code (200 OK).
         Ensure that the data returned matches what was created.
     3.Update (PUT/PATCH):
         Send a request to update specific fields of the resource and validate the response status code (200 OK).
         Retrieve the resource again to confirm that the updates were applied correctly.
     4.Delete (DELETE):
         Send a request to delete the resource and validate the response status code (204 No Content).
         Attempt to retrieve the deleted resource to ensure it returns a 404 Not Found status.
     5.Boundary and Negative Testing:
         Test with invalid data, missing fields, or incorrect data types to ensure the API handles errors gracefully and maintains data integrity.
     6.Transaction Testing:
         If applicable, test scenarios where multiple operations are performed in a single transaction to ensure atomicity (all-or-nothing behavior).
     7.Consistency Checks:
         Perform checks to ensure that related resources maintain referential integrity (e.g., foreign key relationships).

Q25)How do you handle dependencies between different API endpoints in your tests?
ans: To handle dependencies between different API endpoints in tests, I follow these strategies:
     1.Chained Requests:
         Use the response from one API call (like an ID or token) as input for subsequent calls. For example, create a user first and then use the user ID to fetch or update user details.
     2.Test Setup and Teardown:
         Implement setup methods to create necessary data before tests run and teardown methods to clean up after tests. This ensures that each test starts with a known state.
     3.Data Management:
         Use unique identifiers (like timestamps or UUIDs) in test data to avoid conflicts and ensure that tests do not interfere with each other.
     4.Environment Isolation:
         Run tests in isolated environments (like staging or test databases) to prevent interference with production data and other tests.
     5.Mocking and Stubbing:
         For complex dependencies, use mocking frameworks to simulate responses from dependent services, allowing tests to focus on the specific API being tested.
     6.Test Order Control:
         If necessary, control the order of test execution to ensure that dependent tests run after their prerequisites are met.

Q26)What are some common challenges you face when testing APIs, and how do you overcome them?
ans: Common challenges in API testing include:
     1.Lack of Documentation:
         Overcome by exploring the API using tools like Postman, inspecting network calls in the frontend, or collaborating with developers to gather information.
     2.Dynamic Data and State:
         Use environment variables, data-driven testing, and setup/teardown methods to manage dynamic values and ensure consistent test states.
     3.Authentication and Authorization:
         Implement automated token generation and management in test scripts to handle authentication seamlessly.
     4.Rate Limiting:
         Design tests to respect rate limits by adding delays or using throttling techniques to avoid hitting limits during testing.
     5.Asynchronous Responses:
         Implement polling mechanisms or callbacks in tests to handle APIs that respond asynchronously.
     6.Environment Differences:
         Ensure tests are environment-agnostic by using configuration files for URLs, credentials, and other environment-specific settings.
     7.Integration with Third-Party Services:
         Use mocking or stubbing to simulate third-party responses, allowing tests to run independently of external systems.

Q27)How do you test for localization and internationalization in APIs?
ans: To test for localization and internationalization in APIs, I follow these steps:
     1.Test Different Locales:
         Send requests with different locale settings (e.g., Accept-Language header) to verify that the API responds with appropriately localized content.
     2.Validate Date and Number Formats:
         Ensure that dates, times, and numbers are formatted correctly according to the specified locale (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY vs. DD/MM/YYYY).
     3.Check Text Encoding:
         Verify that the API handles various character sets (UTF-8, ISO-8859-1) correctly, especially for languages with special characters.
     4.Test Currency Handling:
         For APIs dealing with financial data, ensure that currency symbols and formats are correct based on the locale.
     5.Error Messages:
         Validate that error messages and status codes are localized appropriately for different languages.
     6.Data Input Validation:
         Test input fields to ensure they accept localized data formats (e.g., phone numbers, postal codes).
     7.Collaborate with Localization Teams:
         Work closely with localization experts to understand cultural nuances and ensure accurate translations and representations.

Q28)How do you test for backward compatibility in APIs when new versions are released?
ans: To test for backward compatibility in APIs when new versions are released, I follow these steps:
     1.Maintain a Regression Test Suite:
         Keep a comprehensive set of automated tests that cover all existing functionalities and endpoints. Run these tests against the new version to ensure nothing is broken.
     2.Versioning Strategy:
         Ensure that the API uses proper versioning (e.g., v1, v2) so that clients can continue using the old version while transitioning to the new one.
     3.Compare Responses:
         For key endpoints, compare responses from the old and new versions to ensure that data structures, field names, and types remain consistent.
     4.Test Deprecated Features:
         Verify that any deprecated features still function as expected and provide appropriate warnings or messages to users.
     5.Client Compatibility Testing:
         If possible, test with existing client applications to ensure they work seamlessly with the new API version without requiring changes.
     6.Document Changes:
         Review and update API documentation to clearly indicate any changes, deprecations, or new features, helping users understand how to adapt.
     7.Communicate with Stakeholders:
         Collaborate with developers and product owners to understand the impact of changes and ensure that all stakeholders are aware of potential compatibility issues.

Q29)How do you test for error handling in APIs, and what are some common error scenarios you look for?
ans: To test for error handling in APIs, I focus on validating that the API responds appropriately to various error conditions. Common error scenarios I look for include:
     1.Invalid Input Data:
         Test with missing required fields, incorrect data types, and out-of-range values to ensure the API returns 400 Bad Request with meaningful error messages.
     2.Authentication and Authorization Failures:
         Verify that requests without valid tokens or with insufficient permissions return 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden status codes.
     3.Resource Not Found:
         Attempt to access non-existent resources to ensure the API returns a 404 Not Found status code.
     4.Method Not Allowed:
         Use unsupported HTTP methods (e.g., POST on a GET-only endpoint) to check for a 405 Method Not Allowed response.
     5.Rate Limiting:
         Exceed the allowed number of requests to confirm that the API returns a 429 Too Many Requests status code with appropriate headers.
     6.Server Errors:
         Simulate server-side issues (e.g., database down) to ensure the API returns a 500 Internal Server Error with a generic message, avoiding exposure of sensitive information.
     7.Timeouts and Network Issues:
         Test how the API handles timeouts and network failures, ensuring it responds gracefully without crashing.
     8.Validation of Error Messages:
         Ensure that error messages are clear, consistent, and provide enough information for users to understand and resolve issues.

Q30)How do you integrate API testing into your overall software development lifecycle (SDLC)?
